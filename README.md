A Python-based project that implements the **Black-Scholes-Merton** model for pricing European call and put options, along with functionality to visualize option Greeks, generate heatmaps, and optionally incorporate real-world **US Treasury yield curve** data.

    <td>A fully interactive <strong>Streamlit</strong> web application is included so you can explore how option prices and Greeks are affected by spot prices, volatility, dividends, and interest rates.

## üìä Features

- **Black-Scholes-Merton Model:** Calculates option prices (Call & Put) and Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta) for European-style options.

- **Dividend Yield Support:** Includes the continuously compounded dividend yield in calculations (B-S-M extended model).

- **US Treasury Yield Curve Integration:**  
  - Fetches the latest XML data from the U.S. Department of the Treasury.
  - Converts yields from semi-annual compounding to continuously compounded form.
  - Interpolates maturities from 1 month out to 30 years.
  - Allows for either a manually specified risk-free rate or an automatically interpolated rate from the yield curve.

- **Visualizations:**  
  - **Heatmaps** of option prices or PnL across a user-defined range of spot prices and volatilities.
  - **Line Plots** of Greeks vs. model parameters (spot, volatility, time to maturity, interest rate).
  - An interactive chart for the **US yield curve**.

- **Testing with Pytest:** Comprehensive tests (`test_scripts.py`) ensure model correctness and code reliability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. **Clone** this repository or download the files.
2. Ensure you have [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed.
3. **Navigate** to the project folder where `environment.yaml` is located.
4. **Create and activate** the conda environment. The environment name is set to envs in environment.yaml. Feel free to rename it inside the YAML file or after creation if needed.

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yaml
   conda activate envs

## üöÄ Usage

### Running the Streamlit App

1. Ensure the conda environment is activated (`conda activate envs`).
2. From the project root, run:

   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
3. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL printed in your terminal.


**Key Steps in the App:**

- **Left Sidebar:** Provide the Spot Price (S), Strike Price (K), Volatility (œÉ), Time to Maturity (T), Risk-Free Rate (r), and Dividend Yield (q).
- **Use US Yield Curve:** Optionally enable the ‚ÄúUse US Yield Curve‚Äù checkbox to interpolate the rate from the most recent yield curve data.
- **Tabs:**  
  - **Option Prices & Greeks:** Explore various Greeks and their sensitivity to model parameters.
  - **Call and Put Price Heatmaps:** Visualize heatmaps for call and put options under user-defined ranges of spot and volatility.
  -	**US Yield Curve Visualization:** Check out the US Treasury yield curve tab to see how the yield data was retrieved and converted.

### Running Tests
To validate the library:

  ```bash
  pytest test_scripts.py
```

All tests are located in the test_scripts.py file. This ensures correct implementation of option pricing, Greeks, yield curve retrieval, and risk-free rate interpolation.
The tests cover the following:
- Price and Greek calculations
- Input validation
- Yield curve fetching & fallback logic
- Sensitivity curve generation
- Exception handling

- **BlackScholes.py:** Implements closed-form solutions for European call and put options, including Greeks like Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Theta. It also supports:
  - Continuous dividend yield
  - Yield curve-based interest rate lookup
  - Heatmap generation
  - Sensitivity (Greek) curves

- **US_YieldCurve.py:** Fetches and interpolates the [Daily U.S. Treasury Par Yield Curve](https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?type=daily_treasury_yield_curve&field_tdr_date_value=2025) from the official XML feed, converting from CMT yields to continuously-compounded yields.

- **streamlit_app.py:** Streamlit front-end where users can interact with the model parameters and see results rendered in real time.

- **test_scripts.py:** A comprehensive test suite using pytest to validate pricing logic, Greeks, edge cases, yield data handling, and Streamlit helper functions.

## üí° Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas for future development:

1. Advanced Models: Add support for the Heston or SABR models to capture stochastic volatility.
2. American Options Extension: Integrate a numerical method (like binomial trees) to value American-style options.
3. Calibration to Market Data: Implement a calibration feature allowing users to calibrate volatility from market option prices.
4. Historical Volatility: Automated retrieval of historical price data to estimate volatility.
5. Enhanced Data Sources: Expand to additional yield curves (e.g., EUR, GBP).
